Having moved often during childhood, she was exposed to many different cultures, communities, and mindsets. This early discovery of social possibilities instilled in her an interest in environmental sciences, urban planning, and social welfare. She attended New York University for undergraduate where she studied Sustainable Urban Environments, and Science and Technology Studies. With this, she devoted her time to research, working in the Technology, Culture and Society Department. Here she created her first thesis research paper: “Aesthetic Prosthetics: Through Beauty, Assistive Technology can be Enhanced”. This paper is currently in peer review. Now in graduate academics, she has pooled all her resources to participate in accessibility research. She hopes to find novel ways of incorporating equality - whether social or physical - in to the built environment. She feels her interdisciplinary background will help her uncover the best ways to do this, and is excited for the endless academic possibilities that await her.",i have multiple showing,i have multiple showing,https://wp.nyu.edu/cassidy/portfolio/,Installation,"Tackling Diversity, Nature & The Environment",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QLzA8kVF-w6OwZX7Z1WveysXuALaHhen/view?usp=sharing,https://wp.nyu.edu/cassidy/portfolio/,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sjii8C2QpuSaGRsbgT3DEgGiNFCvmo69/view?usp=sharing,,https://wp.nyu.edu/cassidy/a-journal-of-coursework/
