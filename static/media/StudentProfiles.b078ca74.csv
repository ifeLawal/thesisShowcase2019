,VIVACIOUS,VAQUITA,thegreatproject,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaquita,http://www.whalesynth.com/,https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/whale/?hl=en,https://twitter.com/whale_alert?lang=en,,"This fellow is a species of porpoise found in the gulf of California, in the stretch of the pristine waters between Mexico and Baja California. This elusive animal was not discovered by scientists until 1958, and half a century later they are at risk of permanently slipping through our fingers.
<br/>
<br/>
They face threats from fisherman as they become entangled and drown in gillnets of illegal marine operations, even within the protected areas of the gulf. It is estimated that this fascinating subspecies of porpoise could be extinct by 2018 if measures are not taken immediately. However, there is a glimmer of hope for the Vaquita as a new agreement has emerged that includes a permanent ban on gillnets and better, less disturbing technology to be used in vaquita habitat. The new agreement certainly looks promising as it has been signed by the Mexican Government, the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, The Carlos Slim Foundation and is officially supported by WWF.",FACTS ABOUT THE VAQUITA,"The eyes of the Vaquita are circled with black rings, and their bodies are grey in colour.
Vaquitas use echo location for hunting as they live in murky waters that make it difficult to see prey clearly.
<br/><br/>
Decreased population causes an increase of inbreeding which births weaker species.
<br/><br/>
This is equally detrimental to the sustainability of the vaquita compared to the other threats they face because only the most advanced species will survive evolution.",https://www.thegreatprojects.com/whale-conservation,Website,"Whales, Long, Huge, Protection",thegreatproject,Ife Lawal,https://storage.googleapis.com/ahead4-thegreatprojects/uploads/ab9b837b5fefeb6f7e8a76ce1d391fc1.jpg,https://turnupthatvolume.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/floodalbum.jpg?w=1000,https://media0.giphy.com/media/l1J3OQZgOKjJhdsUU/source.gif,https://www.youtube.com/embed/S6I916CXqFo
